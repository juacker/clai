/**
 * Opens an external URL in the system browser.
 *
 * Focus caveat: on Wayland (and on macOS/Windows when the browser is
 * already running) the OS may open the URL in an existing browser
 * instance without raising its window — `xdg-open` and friends don't
 * carry a compositor-issued activation token, and self-minted tokens
 * are ignored by strict Wayland compositors. The reliable cross-
 * platform fix is `org.freedesktop.portal.OpenURI` over D-Bus, which
 * we don't wire up here. Accepting the limitation keeps this path a
 * one-liner.
 *
 * @param {string} url - The URL to open
 * @returns {Promise<void>}
