/**
 * StreamingMarkdown
 *
 * Wraps MarkdownMessage with two streaming-specific behaviors so the chat
 * experience feels smooth instead of "popping" in provider-sized bursts:
 *
 *   1. A RAF-driven typewriter buffer that paces the displayed substring
 *      toward the accumulated string. Providers ship deltas in 5-50 char
 *      chunks; without smoothing the UI grows in visible blocks. The
 *      buffer caches up exponentially when far behind so very large bursts
 *      don't feel artificially slow.
 *
 *   2. A "stable preview" of partial markdown — unclosed code fences are
 *      auto-closed, unmatched inline backticks and partial link syntax
 *      are stripped from the tail. The point is to prevent layout
 *      flicker where a block of literal text suddenly turns into a code
 *      block / link / inline-code once the closing token arrives.
 *
 * When `isStreaming` becomes false the wrapper snaps to the full content
 * and stops animating.
