/**
 * ESLint flat config for CLAI frontend.
 *
 * React 19 strict hooks rules are disabled for now because the
 * existing codebase was written before these strict rules existed.
 * Re-enable them incrementally in follow-up PRs:
 *   - react-hooks/set-state-in-effect
 *   - react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
 *   - react-hooks/preserve-manual-memoization
 *   - react-hooks/immutability
 *
 * `react-hooks/purity` was enabled as a warning on 2026-06-05 (clai#5).
 * The current codebase is clean for this rule (0 violations), so the
 * next step is to promote it from `warn` to `error` in a follow-up PR.
 *
 * `react-hooks/use-memo` was enabled as a warning on 2026-06-06 (clai#5).
 * The current codebase is clean for this rule (0 violations) — every
 * `useMemo`/`useCallback` call site already uses an inline arrow
 * function and a simple array-literal dep array. The next step for
 * this rule is also to promote it from `warn` to `error` in a
 * follow-up PR, after the `purity` promotion lands.
 *
 * `react-hooks/refs` was enabled as a warning on 2026-06-06 (clai#5).
 * Unlike the previous two sub-rules, the current codebase is NOT
 * clean for this rule — the rule surfaces 16 violations across
 * 7 files, all of which follow the "latest-value ref" anti-pattern
 * (syncing a prop or state into a ref directly during render, or
 * reading a ref cache to derive a value during render). Examples:
 *   - src/contexts/ChatManagerContext.tsx:54
 *   - src/assistant/useAssistantSession.ts:30
 *   - src/components/Chat/StreamingMarkdown.tsx:38,39
 *   - src/components/common/VirtualizedList.tsx:184,351
 *   - src/components/Settings/WorkspaceSettingsModal.tsx:620,1456,1457,1508
 * These are well-known patterns that the React Compiler explicitly
 * disallows because they bypass React's render model. The fix is
 * to move the sync into `useEffect`/`useLayoutEffect` or to refactor
 * to pass the value directly. That cleanup will land in focused
 * follow-up PRs; this PR is the gate-establishment flip only.
 * Once all 16 are resolved, this rule will be promoted from
 * `warn` to `error` in a separate PR.
