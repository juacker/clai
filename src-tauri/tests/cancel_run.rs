//! Pins the contract between the scheduler runner and
//! `assistant_cancel_run`. Both code paths now agree that the
//! cancellation key is the DB `run.id`; an earlier bug (see
//! `agents/runner.rs` history) registered scheduler tokens under a
//! synthetic `scheduled:{instance_id}:{uuid}` key, making scheduled
//! runs effectively un-cancellable from the UI.
//!
//! These tests use the public `register_run` / `cancel_run` /
//! `unregister_run` surface and simulate the registration calls each
//! path makes. A real end-to-end test would also need an engine turn
//! to consume the cancel token, but the value lives at the key-naming
//! layer: every spawn site must register under run.id.
